## Pothole Dataset

![Example Image](https://i.imgur.com/7Xz8d5M.gif)

This is a collection of 665 images of roads with the potholes labeled. The dataset was created and shared by Atikur Rahman Chitholian as part of his undergraduate thesis and was originally shared on Kaggle.

**Note:** The original dataset did not contain a validation set; we have re-shuffled the images into a [70/20/10 train-valid-test split](https://blog.roboflow.com/train-test-split).

### Usage

This dataset could be used for automatically finding and categorizing potholes in city streets so the worst ones can be fixed faster.

The dataset is provided in a wide variety of formats for various common machine learning models.
